I completed my PhD at University of Edinburgh supervised by Dr. Matthias Hennig. I am now a postdoctoral researcher at the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia University, working with Dr. Liam Paninski. I am a member of the International Brain Laboratory ([IBL](https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/)) and the NSF AI Institute for Artificial and Natural Intelligence ([ARNI](https://arni-institute.org/)).

I build scalable machine learning models that connect neural activity to behavior at single-cell and single-spike resolution. My work spans multimodal transformers, contrastive/self-supervised learning, and probabilistic latent-variable/state-space modeling to advance large-scale electrophysiology and brain-wide decoding. I also co-created [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/spikeinterface), a widely-used open-source framework for creating flexible and robust spike sorting pipelines.
