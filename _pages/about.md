I completed my PhD at University of Edinburgh supervised by Dr. Matthias Hennig. I am now a postdoctoral researcher at the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia University, working with Dr. Liam Paninski as part of the International Brain Laboratory (IBL). 

My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and systems neuroscience, with a focus on developing neuro-foundation models: large-scale, pretrained models of brain activity that generalize across animals, brain regions, and tasks. I also co-developed SpikeInterface, a widely-used open-source framework for creating flexible and robust spike sorting pipelines.
