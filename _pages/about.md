Research
======
I am a current PhD student at the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, University of Edinburgh supervised by
[Dr. Matthias Hennig](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mhennig/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning. In my research, I mainly focus on improving and applying deep generative models, analysing large-scale extracellular recordings, and developing novel software tools for running and benchmarking automated spike sorters.

* New paper: [SpikeForest: reproducible web-facing ground-truth validation of automated neural spike sorters](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.14.900688v1?rss=1).
* New paper: [SpikeInterface, a unified framework for spike sorting](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/796599v1).
* I was awarded a travel grant to attend NeurIPS.
* Our paper [Scalable Spike Source Localization in Extracellular Recordings using Amortized Variational Inference](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8720-scalable-spike-source-localization-in-extracellular-recordings-using-amortized-variational-inference) was accepted at NeurIPS 2019.
