Research
======
I am a postdoctoral researcher at Zuckerman Institute, Columbia University working with Dr. Liam Paninski and the International Brain Laboratory (IBL). My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning. My current research is focused on improving analysis methods for high-density extracellular recordings through the application of modern machine learning methods. I am also working on novel approaches for analyzing the neuronal dynamics underlying behavior and video tracking of behavior.
