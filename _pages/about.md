Research
======
I am a current PhD student at the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, University of Edinburgh supervised by
[Dr. Matthias Hennig](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mhennig/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning. In my research, I mainly focus on improving and applying deep generative models, analysing large-scale extracellular recordings, and developing novel software tools for running and benchmarking automated spike sorters.
