Research
======
I am a current PhD student at the Institute for Adaptive and Neural Computation, University of Edinburgh supervised by
[Dr. Matthias Hennig](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mhennig/). My research interests lie at the intersection of computational neuroscience and machine learning where I focus on improving and applying deep generative models, analyzing large-scale neural recordings, and developing novel software tools for running and benchmarking automated spike sorters. Recently, I have been expanding my research to dynamical models of neural population recordings.
